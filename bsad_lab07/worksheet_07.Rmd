### About

In this lab we will focus on sensitivity analysis and monte carlo simulations. 

Sensitivity analysis is the study of how the uncertainty in the output of a mathematical model or system (numerical or otherwise) can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs. In this lab we will use the lpSolveAPI package as we did in the previous lab. 

Monte Carlo Simulations utilize repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. 

Below is the Monte Carlo method applied to approximating the value of ??, which is a good representation of Monte Carlo similations. After placing 30,000 random points, the estimate for ?? is within 0.07% of the actual value.

In this lab, we will learn how to generate random samples with various simulations. 

### Setup

Make sure to download the folder titled 'bsad_lab7' zip folder and extract the folder to unzip it. Next, we must set this folder as the working directory. The way to do this is to open R Studio, go to 'Session', scroll down to 'Set Working Directory', and click 'To Source File Location'. Now, follow the worksheet directions to complete the lab.

----------

### Task 1 

We will be solving the marketing case in Chapter 7 and performing a sensitivity analysis. You may use Solve in Excel, and if you do so, screenshot the results and attach them below. 

If we use R, we must first download the appropriate package. 
```{r}
# LP Optimization - package install
install.packages("lpSolveAPI") 

# load package library
library("lpSolveAPI")
```

Now, we will solve the marketing case (Chapter 7). 
```{r}
# model object
lprec <- make.lp(0, 2)

# set for maximum
lp.control(lprec, sense="max") 
set.objfn(lprec, c(275.691, 48.341))
```

Add constrains to the model.

```{r}
add.constraint(lprec, c(1, 1), "<=", 350000)
add.constraint(lprec, c(1, 0), ">=", 15000)
add.constraint(lprec, c(0, 1), ">=", 75000)
add.constraint(lprec, c(2, -1), "=", 0)
add.constraint(lprec, c(1, 0), ">=", 0)
add.constraint(lprec, c(0, 1), ">=", 0)
```

Now, view the problem setting in tabular/matrix form. This is a good checkpoint!

```{r}
lprec
# solve
solve(lprec) 
```

Next we get the optimum results.
```{r}
# display the objective function optimum value
get.objective(lprec)

# display the variables optimum values
get.variables(lprec)
```

Lastly, we obtain the sensitivity results. 
```{r}

# display sensitivity to coefficients of objective function
get.sensitivity.obj(lprec)

# display sensitivity to right hand side constraints
get.sensitivity.rhs(lprec) 
```

In the space below, write a small paragraph to explain/interpret the sensitivity results highlighting the binding/non-binding constraints, the surplus/slack, and marginal values.

Now, try to reproduce the results above by making independent small changes to the objective function coefficients, and to the constraints. Each time re-run the Excel or R code model. Mark your results, compare your findings with the above results, and share your observations.

### Task 2

Now we will be running a Monte Carlo simulation in Excel and in R. We will be using S&P weekly cumulative return > 5%. 
First, for Excel, refer to the guidelines in the 3 minute video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKdmEXCvo9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKdmEXCvo9s). Reproduce in Excel the S&P example using NORMINV (returns the inverse of the normal cumulative distribution for the specified mean and standard deviation).  Consider only 100 simulations. Take a screenshot of your work and paste it below. 

Now, we will use R to genereate 100 random samples from a normal distribution with a mean of 0.03 (%) and a  standard deviation of 0.97 (%). Given the 100 random samples, calculate the mean, standard deviation, and probability of occurrence where the simulation result is greater than 5%. 

To do this in R, simply use the rnorm() function. See the example below for the number of runs to 100.

```{r}
# number of simulations/samples
runs <- 100 
# random number generator per defined normal distribution
sims <-  rnorm(runs,mean=0.03,sd=0.97)
```

```{r}
# Mean calculated from the random distribution based on samples
average <- mean(sims)
average
```

```{r}
# STD calculated from the random distribution based on samples
std <- sd(sims) 
std
```

```{r}
# probability of occurrence on any given day based on samples
prob <- sum(sims >=0.05)/runs
prob
```

Remember, each time that this code runs, new numbers will be generated. Still though, write all of the observations for each case where the number of `runs = 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000`.  

Describe how the values change/behave as the number of simulations increase. What is your best bet on the probability of occurrence greater than 5%? What are some trends that we see? How is this similar to the ?? image that was discussed in the introductory paragraph?
